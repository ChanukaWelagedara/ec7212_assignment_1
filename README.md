# Computer Vision and Image Processing - Assignment 1

This repository consist with the implementation of various image processing techniques.

## Overview

This repositort demonstrates the application of fundamental image processing operations:

1. **Intensity Level Reduction**: Reducing the number of intensity levels in grayscale images from 256 to lower powers of 2
2. **Spatial Averaging**: Applying average filtering with different kernel sizes (3×3, 10×10, and 20×20)
3. **Image Rotation**: Rotating images by 45° and 90°
4. **Resolution Reduction**: Replacing non-overlapping blocks with their average values for varying block sizes

## Contents

- `assignment1_4276.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all implementations
- Image files:
 ## How to Use

1. Open the `assignment1_4276.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
2. Update the image path in the notebook to point to one of the provided images
3. Run the cells to see the effects of various image processing operations
4. Use the interactive widgets to experiment with different parameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ipywidgets (for interactive elements)

## Results

The notebook generates visual comparisons between original images and their processed versions.
